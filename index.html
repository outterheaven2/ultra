	<h1>NATURE'S POWER</h1>
	<h2>The rules of that Power</h2> 

	<p>People around the world always seem to underestimate nature's power
       and all it's forms. So to have a better understanding of it here
	   are 3 simple but effective rules to keep you alive, respect, and
	   appreiciate that terrifing and beautiful power that surrounds us
	   at all times.</p>

	<p>RULE 1. Nature will never be in our control. It sheer arrogance to
       assume that nature is in our control. Unless your one of those people
	   that think you can take on a charging grizzly bear, my money's
	   on the bear FYI. Know your limits in nature for it is far larger
	   than you.</p>

	<p>Rule 2. Appreciate it. Everyone need to take a stress relief why not
	   walk a trail, sit next to a river, look out to the ocean, or watch
	   birds fly by. Then you will see with all this majestic beauty your
	   stress and other probelms seem so insignificant. This will make
	   you appreicated even more.</p>
    
	<p> Rule 3. Respect. You'd be a total fool to be in the middle of a
        lightning storm while recording it thinking " I'll be fine" or driving
	    during a hurricane thinking " No Prob". Unless your name is Storm
	    from the X-men you will not be fine. Respect that power at all times
	    challenge it and you will lose the bet. Don't believe me check 
	    out the video below.</p>
